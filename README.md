Powershell-Modules
==================
This project is a collection of various PowerShell modules, which I have been developing during personal studies and research.
Please reference the appropriate version-named branch for versions which are deemed releasable.

This is a development branch, not intended to be releasable.

The modules in this branch have been targeted for PowerShell 4.0 or greater.
Branches which start with the name 'legacy', are intended to be compatible with systems which only have PowerShell 2.0 and supports only c# 2.0 for custom types and assemblies.
